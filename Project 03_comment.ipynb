    "Based on the calibration results, the volatility increases from 0.158 to 0.1617 for 1 and 3 months, respectively. Theoretically, volatility should increase with duration. However, the volatility for 6 months back-calculates a volatility of 0.137. This is probabilty due to the limited suitable data for 6 months and no options have strike price close to spot price within 2% difference. \n",
    "\n",
    "If all the data from the three durations are combined and regressed, the volatility is about 0.156, which is close to the average value of 0.152"
